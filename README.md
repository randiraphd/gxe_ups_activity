# gxe_ups_activity
Code for "Genotype-by-environment interactions shape ubiquitin-proteasome system activity" by Randi Avery, Mahlon Collins, and Frank Albert

Code is split up into two directories: one for code analyzing and summarizing flow cytometry data on the BY and RM strains (gxe_ups_activity/Parental flow cytometry analysis/) and one for code analyzing and summarizing sequencing data to call QTLs (gxe_ups_activity/QTL code/). Each directory includes analyses for measuring GxE in the respective data.
