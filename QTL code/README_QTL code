These scripts are used to analyze sequencing data from "Genotype-by-environment interactions shape ubiquitin-proteasome system activity".
Whole-genome sequencing data is available through the NIH Sequence Read Archive under Bioproject accession PRJNA1201919.

Scripts are numbered in the order they should be used, along with necessary text files, numbered according to which script they are used in.
Begin with gxe_ups_activity/QTL code/Albert Lab QTL scripts/ for the initial processing of sequencing data.
